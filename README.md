## What's going on with his project?

At the moment, I'm no longer working on this assignment/project, as I've handed it in and it doesn't hold my interest as much as other projects that I have.

## What is this?

Firstly, it's an assignment of mine for a year two degree modules, Object Orientated Programming II. 

It's a simple tool for working out what class of degree you're going to acheive based on your module results.

The application will either:

- Calculate your the degree classification that you are going to acheive based on the modules and assessments entered. If you have not entered enough modules and assessments, it will show that you have failed.

- Calculate your degree classification using the marks you've entered to predict marks for other that you have not entered marks for 

## Known issues

- If you don't enter in at least one module, with at least one assigment with a result, for each year, the application will crash when enabling prediction.
- Validation of entering new modules and assignments has not been thoroughly tested
- You cannot delete or edit modules or assignments
